# Fancy Bee NFT. 
## Follow me on twitter at @fancyB_nft

## EthGlobal Demo

1. Bees will be free minted, user pays gas fees. Bees will not come with clothing, you will have to buy the clothing to dress them.

2. User will mint a bee & and an outfit on our dapp and combine the NFTs through the DAO. 

<!-- 3. Transactions will go through a DAO & royalities will be sent to the Treasury and the Charity.

4. A bee can pay to reroll base stats and even outfit stats. -->

## Project ideas
1. Genesis pieces: Rarest will have best traits and properties.

2. Genesis Outfits: Will provide best stats and additional properties.

2. All bees will be associated with a random "Hive". 

3. Royalties of each Bee & Outfit is donated to a charity in the "Hive". 

4. Bees will have rarity stats dependent on garment and accesory combinations. Secondly, they will have dynamic stats measured in community participation. 

5. Bees will have roles, all genesis bees will be Royals (queen or king).

6. Bees will double as jpegs and gifs. As an owner you will have access to each frame.

## Questions to ponder: 

1. What side-effects would occur with fractional genesis bees?
2. What more can we do to encourage people to think about bees and the importance of fighting climate change?
3. What use cases could special licensing be used for attracting more people to buy bees?
4. Gains on a sale is taxable, but what about the donation made on every sale? Is that tax-deductible?
5. What would be the best use case for creating an ERC-1155 Fancy Bee?
6. How am I going to get metadata that updates? Where am I going to store that data?
7. Does the DAO have its own token and what are the tokenomics behind it?
