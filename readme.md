# Fancy Bee NFT. 
## Follow me on twitter at @fancyB_nft

## Project ideas
1. Fractional genesis pieces. Rarest will have functions that need majority to execute.

2. Genesis pieces will be spilt into "regions", each "region" will have one charity. 

3. A percentage of each sale is donated to a charity in the "region" the bee is sold. 

4. Bees will have rarity stats dependent on garment and accesory combinations. Secondly, they will have dynamic stats measured in community participation. 

5. Bees will have roles, all genesis bees will be Royals (queen or king).

6. Bees will double as stills and gifs.

## Questions to ponder: 

1. What side-effects would occur with generative genesis bees?
2. What more can we do to encourage people to think about bees and the importance of fighting climate change?
3. What use cases could special licensing be used for attracting more people to buy bees?
4. Gains on a sale is taxable, but what about the donation made on every sale? Is that tax-deductible?
5. What would be the best use case for creating an ERC-1155 Fancy Bee?
6. How am I going to get metadata that updates? Where am I going to store that data?
7. What are the contracts going to look like?  
8. Should the front-end be decentralized too? 
9. What am I not thinking of?


## Future plans
**TBD**
